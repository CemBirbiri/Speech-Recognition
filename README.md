# Speech Recognition project

The goals of this project are:
- Evaluating the performance of deploying the [DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech) Speech-To-Text model on a device without GPU accelaration.
- A qualitative analysis of Deep Speech model such as CPU speed and memory
- Getting a quantitative intuition behind what goes right/wrong in prediction (*e.g.* with [Word Error Rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_error_rate)).

A PDF report is available in the repository.

The dataset used in this project is the Switchboard Hub5â€™00 and can be found:
